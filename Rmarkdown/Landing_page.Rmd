## My Techinical Writing Journey

I am a enthusiast for creating useful and exciting documentation. This is driven by my passion for removing ambiguity through my analytical and problem-solving capabilities  

I began technical writing while completing my PhD in  University College Dublin. There I was writing research protocols and summarizing scientific experiments for peer review publication. 

During my postdoc at the University of New South Wales. I have facilitated bioinformatic workshops for the clinical school. These workshops had diverse audiences (clinicians, allied health professionals and students) with varied knowledge of the subject matter. I created documentation to compliment the workshops and for attendees to work independently. I also created documentation for use of in house pipelines and various other protocols as required.

In 2020, I had the opportunity to contribute the New South Wales pandemic Response. I worked as a Senior Data Analyst/Team Lead on the epidemiology team. The role involved building and automating analytical outputs of population based COVID-19 data. These automated reports required documentation which I was responsible for managing. The work in the pandemic response is fast paced and highly dynamic. We had new analysts joining regularly and I created documentation to on-board the new recruits! 

From there I joined Janssen Australia, as a Project Manager on the Real World Evidence team. There I developed a SharePoint site for the team and upgraded the team documentation to be interactive and user friendly.
